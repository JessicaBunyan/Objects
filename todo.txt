**Create design for Pillars
*   1 armed bandit / vending machine crossover

**Create design for invetory
*    Location - inside viewport or no?
*   Always open? or not. Yes I think so

**Folder Structure per component?
* src/components/Scene1/Scene1Pillar? think about it

** Fix click animation for method buttons.

** Tracking game state - centralise method of doing this
* At the moment we're just manually updating game state from the scene - this aint great.
* We should be calling a method on the Game component - like how we do for adding inv items.

** Clean up parameters 
* The arguments don't line up with the slots esp with the colours

later on
we need to think about game state how do we store its
lower level we need scene game state. 

Scene 1 when is it complete? You can still use the methods
Complete is not the word/var name. Should be "created" or exists or instantiated.

Can other things cause method pillars to appear over time?
are we going to want to re-run constructors ever?
Each scene could have like 8 constr pillar slots and 8 method pillar slots and we use a bitmap basically which gets passed in
Who's responsibility is it to keep track of the state of the scene. Itself presumably? Or the parent? I think maybe the parent
So 



also need to think about image management tbh


are those header/attribute things in c# just decorators?
