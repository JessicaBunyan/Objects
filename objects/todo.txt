need to sort out scene transition

Get a navigations scene drawing with a child scene that comes in from props

Do css modularised by scene number


Need to separate out all the shit from Scene1 that really belongs in ObjectScene
e.g rendering methods




Need to check the object scenes can hold their own individula state
had to turn on runOnAllFiles back on tog et flow working


Ok so we need to do some structuring

Css - shrinking stuff that's not in an active scene
Maybe its best to pass in a class that's applied to all elements
Or we can transform: scale the scene but I worry if this will affect everything within the scene. Need to test this with position: absolute stuff too.

Or we use some sort of decorator that modifies the state to manipulate the styles? Seems awfully involved.

Or we could write something that for every selector with width and height recalcs the mini dimensions and creates a corresponding .mini class/selector





We need to variable this shit up in less.
We need to make the whole thing bigger its tiny.

we need to sort out splitting up NavScene and NavScene1







later on
we need to think about game state how do we store its
lower level we need scene game state. 

Scene 1 when is it complete? You can still use the methods
Complete is not the word/var name. Should be "created" or exists or instantiated.

Can other things cause method pillars to appear over time?
are we going to want to re-run constructors ever?
Each scene could have like 8 constr pillar slots and 8 method pillar slots and we use a bitmap basically which gets passed in
Who's responsibility is it to keep track of the state of the scene. Itself presumably? Or the parent? I think maybe the parent
So 






are those header/attribute things in c# just decorators?
